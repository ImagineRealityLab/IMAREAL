# IMAREAL
Data, experimental and analysis code for "Fundamental constraints on distinguishing reality and imagination". Each experimental folder contains the data as a zip-file and a 'MasterWrapper.m' script which walks through all analyses steps and create the figures reported in the paper. All analysis scripts are in MATLAB (we used version R2018b). The data needs to be unzipped before the script can be run. The simulations folder also contains a 'MasterWrapper.m' script that runs all simulations and creates the figures. All analyses/simulations should run within minutes. 

'JatosCode' contains the HTML experimental code. Requires JsPsych 6.1.0 to run. Copy the JsPsych toolbox into each experimental folder prior to running.
